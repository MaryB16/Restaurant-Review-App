## Description
For this project Udacity has provided a static restaurant review webpage. The project had the following goals:
* *Add interactivity*: Modify the static site to add interactive features
* *Responsive design*: Modify the existing css and html files to make the webpage responsive on a range of display sizes.
* *Accessibility*: Implement a series of features that make the website more accessible to screen readers.
* *Service Worker*: Add a service worker that will cache requests to the site's assets so that the website can be viewed when the user is offline.

### How to run the server 
- Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Visit the site in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
* **Important** `python -m http.server 8000` works for windows OS, if you are using Mac IOS/linux use `python3 -m http.server 8000`
