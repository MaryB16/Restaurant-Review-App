# Restaurant Review App
This is the 6th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Description
For this project Udacity has provided a static restaurant review webpage. The project had the following goals:

* *Responsive design*: Modify the existing css and html files to make the webpage responsive on a range of display sizes.
* *Accessibility*: Implement a series of features that make the website more accessible to screen readers.
* *Service Worker*: Add a service worker that will cache requests to the site's assets so that the website can be viewed when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.

### How to run the server
Download the project on your computer. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 
- Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Visit the site in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
* **Important** `python -m http.server 8000` works for windows OS, if you are using  Mac IOS/linux  write `python3 -m http.server 8000`
